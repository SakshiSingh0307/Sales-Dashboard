# Sales Dashboard 

1. Data Preparation  
   - I sourced the sales data from Kaggle, which contained essential metrics such as sales, profit, categories, and regions.  
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by removing duplicates, addressing missing values, and standardizing formats to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2. Importing Data into Power BI  
   - Opened Power BI Desktop and used the **Get Data** feature to connect and load the dataset.  
   - Verified the data integrity after loading to ensure seamless visualization creation.  

3. Building the Dashboard  
   - **Overview Metrics**:  
     - Designed card visualizations to display critical KPIs such as total sales, profit, and order counts.  
   - **Sales Analysis by Category**:  
     - Developed a bar chart to visualize sales performance across categories such as Technology, Office Supplies, and Furniture.  
   - **Sales by Sub-Category**:  
     - Created a horizontal bar chart to highlight the sales distribution of sub-categories like Phones, Chairs, and Binders.  
   - **Sales by Ship Mode**:  
     - Incorporated a stacked bar chart to show sales by different shipping methods, including Standard Class, Second Class, and Same Day.  
   - **Time-Based Trends**:  
     - Added line charts to illustrate sales and profit trends across months for comprehensive time-series analysis.  
   - **Segment and Payment Method Analysis**:  
     - Used pie charts to break down sales contributions by customer segments and payment methods for detailed insights.

4. Publishing the Dashboard  
   - Saved the completed Power BI file locally.  
   - Published the dashboard to the Power BI service to facilitate sharing and collaboration.  
   - Configured permissions and scheduled data refreshes to keep the report up-to-date for stakeholders.
